/// This constraint represents interaction between two cogwheels.

/// This is a simple one-dimensional constraint only. In order to create a meaningful mechanism, the elements linked
/// must be connected to other external constraints with additional hinge constraints. This constraintData has a helper
/// functions that will allow you to easily create those.
///
/// Note that the axes of the cog wheels don't have to be fixed at one relative position. The wheel axes are free
/// to move in a (physically sensible) range. And the constraints should properly track the contact point of the wheels.
/// It will also work, when the cogs are physically disjoint at times.
///
/// If you experience stability problems in bigger setups, the external prismatic and hinge constraints should
/// have higher priority (hkpConstraintInstance::PRIORITY_TOI_HIGHER or higher), or the rack-and-pinion constraint
/// should be added as first.
