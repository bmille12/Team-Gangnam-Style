	/// A wrapper class for a semaphore.
	/// Semaphores are about 10 times slower than critical sections, but
	/// they are more flexible.
	/// You can think of a Semaphore as a set of tokens.
	/// A call to acquire() grabs a token and release puts a token back.
	/// If acquire() can not get a token, it simply waits until another thread calls release.
	/// If the number of tokens is maxCount, release will do nothing.
